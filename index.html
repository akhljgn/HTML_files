        Subaru cars are known for their use of a boxer engine layout in most vehicles above 1,500 cc. The Symmetrical All Wheel Drive drive-train layout was introduced in 1972. Both became standard equipment for mid-size and smaller cars in most markets by 1996. The lone exception is the BRZ, introduced in 2012 via a partnership with Toyota, which pairs the boxer engine with rear-wheel-drive. Subaru also offers turbocharged versions of their passenger cars, such as the WRX, Legacy and Outback XT, Ascent, and formerly the Legacy GT and Forester XT.
        
        In Western markets, Subaru vehicles have traditionally attracted a small but devoted core of buyers. The company's marketing targets those who desire its signature engine and drive train, all-wheel drive and rough-road capabilities, or affordable sports car designs.[8]
        
        Subaru is the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster M45, or the "Seven Sisters" (one of whom tradition says is invisible – hence only six stars in the Subaru logo), which in turn inspires the logo and alludes to the companies that merged to create FHI.[9]</p>

    In Asian countries outside of Japan, Subaru vehicles, parts and accessories are supplied by Motor Image Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hong Kong-listed and Singapore-headquartered Tan Chong International Limited under businessman Glenn Tan.

    Subaru has entered the Philippine operations started in 1996 under the Columbian Motors Philippines ownership but withdrew in 2000. Subaru models were temporarily sold in GM Autoworld dealerships from 2000 to 2005.[30] The brand re-entered the market in 2006 under the new management by Motor Image Pilipinas, Inc.[31] Subaru has seventeen dealerships in the country: Greenhills, Pasig, Manila Bay, Alabang, Davao, Cebu, Cagayan de Oro, Iloilo, Santa Rosa, Batangas, Bonifacio Global City, Taguig, General Santos, Cavite, Legazpi, Albay, Camarines Sur, Bacolod, and Pampanga.[32] Subaru has seen popularity in their SUV line-up in the market in recent years, with the Forester and the XV being one of their popular selling models.

    Subaru once had a presence in South Korea, established in 2009 in Yongsan, Seoul under Choi Seung-dal.[33] Sales started in April 2010 with the Legacy, Outback and Forester as the initial lineup for the South Korean market.[33] They were the fifth Japanese automobile manufacturer to enter after Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi.[34] According to the company, they delayed their entry due to market dominance by Hyundai and Kia.[34] By 2012, Subaru Korea announced that they would discontinue selling 2013 car models due to low sales.[35]

    Current production in 2019 is planned for 6,000 vehicles for Forester model only.[37] In 2008, the Impreza was the first 4-door and first 4WD vehicle to win a race.
