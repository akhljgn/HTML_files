                <h1>TAJ MAHAL</h1>
                <p>
                    The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/; lit. 'Crown of the Palace')[4][5][6] is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

                    Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion.[7] The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.

                    The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.[13][14] Construction started in 1632,[15] and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later.[16] The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.[17] According to contemporary historians Muhammad Amin Qazvini,

                    India is a truly diverse country, be it culturally or geographically. No two cities or states are the same! And that means, there are plenty of amazing holiday destinations for different types of travellers, across the country. However, there are certain places that are heavily frequented by tourists and some people even end up visiting the same destination several times. Such cliched destinations have a charm of their own though and usually promise a timeless experience every time. So, in this blog, we will talk about the top 15 places to visit in India that are totally worth the hype.By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[31][32][33] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[31] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan.[87] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[88][87] the first urban culture in South Asia,[89] which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.[90] Centred on cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.

                    With its sumptuous pink-hued palaces overlooking a series of placid lakes, Udaipur in Rajasthan is probably India’s most immediately romantic city. While the lakefront has been overtaken by hotels, head to the labyrinthine backstreets to find the true heart of the city and experience the Udaipur of old, as you wind past traditional havelis and historic bazaars. Alternatively, approach the romantic Taj Lake Palace from the water and admire its irresistible old-time allure.

                        Where to stay: There are plenty of uber-romantic places to stay in Udaipur, many on Lake Pichola. The Amet Haveli is one of the best, built in the 18th century. The rooms have glittering lakeside views, and the restaurant and pool are sublime.
